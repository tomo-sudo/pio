#
# We need to explicitly specify the architecture because the Xen
# upstream build system likes to use `uname' which can produce wrong
# answers it other-bitness chroots, and because we need to build a
# 64-bit hypervisor even on i386 (since there is no 32-bit hypervisor
# anymore).

# Also there is terminological confusion.  The DEB_* variables follow
# GNU GCC terminology:
#
# dpkg / GNU    Xen         Meaning
#  BUILD         COMPILE     Host: where this build is running
#  HOST          TARGET      Target: where the binaries we build now will run

# and do these three things:
#  1. in the file contents
#    (a) substitute @version@ @flavour@
#    (b) interpret lines like
#		? flavour = <value> [ | <other-value> ...]
#		? flavour != <value> [ | <other-value> ...]
#     as conditional output lasting until the next ? on is own.
#  2. replace any V in the file *name* with that same version
#     and any F with the flavour
#  3. strip .vsn-in from the end
# The resulting files are then consumed by dh.
#
# (debhelper has a shell script control file facility, but that cannot
# handle the need to vary the actual filename seen by debhelper.)
