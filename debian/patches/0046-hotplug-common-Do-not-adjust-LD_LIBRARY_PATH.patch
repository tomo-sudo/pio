Subject: hotplug-common: Do not adjust LD_LIBRARY_PATH

This is in the upstream script because on non-Debian systems, the
default install locations in /usr/local/lib might not be on the linker
path, and as a result the hotplug scripts would break.

A reason we might need it in Debian is our multiple version
coinstallation scheme.  However, the hotplug scripts all call the
utilities via the wrappers, and the binaries are configured to load
from the right place anyway.

This setting is an annoyance because it requires libdir, which is an
arch-specific path but comes from a file we want to put in
xen-utils-common, an arch:all package.

So drop this setting.
