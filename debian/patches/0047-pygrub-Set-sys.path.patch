Subject: pygrub: Set sys.path

We install libfsimage in a non-standard path for Reasons.
(See debian/rules.)

This patch was originally part of `tools-pygrub-prefix.diff'
(eg commit 51657319be54) and included changes to the Makefile to
change the installation arrangements (we do that part in the rules now
since that is a lot less prone to conflicts when we update) and to
shared library rpath (which is now done in a separate patch).

(Commit message rewritten by Ian Jackson.)
